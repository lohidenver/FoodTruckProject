LESSONS LEARNED

Time for some honesty.  

I felt completely overwhelmed and hired a tutor to come over and help guide me through this project.  There is no way I would have completed this project on my own without his help.  I learned a lot from his one on one help but more importantly I learned that I need to spend more time on the weekends catching up to concepts that I missed.  I feel like I am a few days behind and having a migraine for 48 plus hours this week didn't help.  I get them at least once a week and it's going to be difficult to stay current.  I love this new career path and I know if I'm persistent it will be the right career move.  

I purchased some additional books on Java to help me try to keep up.

As far as the actual develpment of the project.  I used some preplanning and diagramming on paper what needed to happen. I was able to do most of the FoodTruck.java class on my own borrowing some concepts from the car.java projects we worked on in class. I struggled with the FoodTruckApp.java and thats where the tutors help really came in.  

He taught me some small things that weren't covered in class such as buffering with a println statement.
